                There were a few types of programmes under JPA that were being advertised, to name a few, JKPJ, Program Penajaan Cemerlang(PPC) and in my case, it is JPA-MARA Programme.  PPC is particularly for the students who are being listed only, by that means getting 9A+ and above in SPM. The requirements for JKPJ and JPA-MARA were way lenient, but it still asks you for a very excellent result, plus the competition is very tough. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I honestly do not know in detail what is the difference between these two programmes, but from what I remember, the MARA in JPA-MARA stands for Bumiputera only. Obviously, this does not apply for the JKPJ Programme and the countries to pursue the study are also different.

              <p><b>
                Sincere Warning:  Discovering Your Passion Is The MOST Important Part of Scholarship Application
              </b></p>

              <p>
                During my high school, I was a pure science stream student, and I got all A+ for science subjects, Alhamdulillah. Nevertheless, this did not stop me from pursuing what I really wanted to do in my life, hence that is why I was looking for a social science preparation programme. If you have the same issue with what I faced earlier, worry not, estimatedly 80% of the social science students taking IB Programme came from pure science stream backgrounds. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Discovering what you really want to do in your life is what matters the most before you are going to apply for any scholarships or universities. Mark my word, because this is your future you are deciding for.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before starting to apply, please check first on JPA Website about their scholarships offer, and make sure it is the latest one because it might have changed from the previous years. You will see lots of sub-programmes under the JPA-MARA Programme and you may choose based on your field of interest in study.
              </p>

              <p>
                The preparation college would be different for each country, such as for the social science in UK, Kolej Mara Banting is where you are going to sit for IB programme, or you can obtain A-levels to pursue study in New Zealand  at Kolej Yayasan Saad, KYSB. If you prefer to go for local university, if I am not mistaken, JPA offers the social science study at Taylor University. 
              </p>

              <p>
                However, please note that, all these countries and preparation colleges are subject to changes, so please refer to the latest information as I mentioned before. Not to forget, do read all the important information about the programme and the agreement that will be involved if you manage to secure the scholarship. You will find that the JPA-MARA Programme will require you to work with the government for around 7-8 years after you finish the study if you want to convert the loan into a full scholarship.  
              </p>
              
              <p>Alright, let us go deeper into the stages that I went through in obtaining the scholarship. After you have chosen the programmes and completely fill the online form, the JPA will then ask you to sit for a personality test on the website given. There are a few different sections of the test, and yes, there is no right or wrong answer for each question. Just answer all the questions honestly, and try to avoid bias in answering the test such as trying to be someone else. Be consistent and do not forget to click on the submit button! (Note: please pay attention to the deadline of the test so you do not miss the test) </p>

              <p>Moving on to the next step, JPA will send you an email that provides you the guidelines to prepare for the 2 minutes video which needs to be submitted in the timeline given. It is quite challenging as the video must be single-shooted and any editing is not allowed unless you would like to improve the quality of the audio. However, I believe that this rule was created to assess your communication and time management skills better. If I am about to recall the content of the video, which if I am not mistaken, they ask me on why I chose the programme given, and how I see myself in 5 years to 10 years from now. </p>

              <p>During my time, the first question had to be answered in the Malay language, while the second one was in English. These questions are also subject to changes based on what JPA would like to ask. My advice is, do not waste your critical 2 minutes video with something petty, unnecessary or redundant. Instead, provide simple but precise answers that may impress the scholarship panels. Not to forget, please follow all the instructions carefully, and give your very best.
              </p>

              <p>Last but not least, the most crucial part of the application is undoubtedly the interview session. As the physical interview cannot take place, which I believe will remain the same for this year, you may have to sit for an online interview through the preferred platforms, in my case, via Google Meet. The interview took place in a group of 5 but each candidate was accessed individually. Few tips for you, please answer when being asked only, and in which language they want. I remember that I have to introduce myself in Malay Language while answering another question in English. Common questions such as introducing yourself and what you can contribute back to the country will surely be asked and make sure to be well prepared.</p>

              <p>Answer all the questions wisely, and do not panic, as they might also ask for unexpected questions, such as I was being asked to recite the Rukun Negara Principle. It may seem easy, but if you lose your grasp, you might lose the chance to answer well. If possible, you may try to give any questions to them too as it might score you an extra point. During the entire session, make sure to have a strong internet connection and prepare the necessary backups such as the extra devices in case any unforeseen circumstances occur, </p>

              <p>To wrap it all up, I would say that you should try your very best for the application process if you are interested in applying to this programme. It might be tough, but I believe that you can be tougher for this! Be extra prepared for the interview especially, as you will have the advantage over those who donâ€™t (he who fails to prepare, prepares to fail!). Kindly avoid any technical mistakes during this whole online application and interview process because they might be extra strict for this kind of mistakes. Always do double checking and pay extra attention to the guidelines given! InsyaAllah, with your best efforts and His will, you will get the chance to become one of the JPA family members! </p>

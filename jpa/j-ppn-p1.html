                Well, hi there! First and foremost, I would like to congratulate all of you who managed to do your best to complete your SPM even with the pandemic still going on and the lockdown to boot. Give yourself a pat on the back, you really did a great job! Now, you need to move on and decide your path for your future. Here, I will share my experience applying for JPA PPN, which stands for Program Penajaan Nasional. Enjoy, and have fun reading! :)
              </p>
            
              <p>
                PPN 9A+  is one of the scholarships offered by Jabatan Perkhidmatan Awam (JPA) for 20 or more (it depends) outstanding students who manage to get excellent results in their SPM. Don’t worry, it is open to all Malaysian students. The selected candidates will be offered a sponsorship to study at KYUEM up to the first degree at the best universities in the world, whether in the USA or in the UK as listed in QS World University Rankings or THE World University Rankings. 
              </p>

              <h2 class="section-heading">Stage 1: Application</h2>

              <p>
                Firstly, you need to check whether your name is listed on the list of the eligible candidates. Eligible candidates here refer to the students that meet the requirements. Then you can apply and complete your profile here before the deadline.
              </p>

              <p>
                Actually, you can apply for more than one JPA scholarship. If you are lucky enough, you can get offers from all of them. For me, I only applied for JPA PPN because I thought that I would only be getting one offer. This is wrong guys, you can apply as many as you want. However, my tip is this :  only apply for the one that you really dream of, and one that truly matches your interest.
              </p>

              <p>
                Give chances to other people, just apply for one or two that you are most confident in and truly want. JPA will choose the one that is better and suitable for you. In the end, you will only receive only one offer letter, so choose wisely.
              </p>

              <p>
                Do fill in ALL of the sections required and submit all of the documents needed. Re-check them very carefully. At this point, you should already have in mind which course you plan to pursue, and in which country. When I was filling out the form, I did my research for all of the courses because they were quite rare and new to me. 
              </p>

              <p>
                After giving it some thought, I chose neurotechnology, which combines engineering and medicine. It is certainly a unique field. What made me want to explore more about the brain was when I stumbled upon some research conducted by universities prominently known for their neurotechnology department. The researchers tried to connect the brain of someone who was paralyzed with some machines. This fascinating project became a turning point for my motivation to become a neurotechnologist. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Maybe, I could be the first neurotechnologist in Malaysia! Who knows. >-< Just believe in yourself, aim high, and start thinking about your future!
              </p>

              <p>
                For the aptitude tests, be true to yourself. Don’t try to manipulate your way into getting this scholarship, because the truth can always be told during the actual interview!
              </p>

              <h2 class="section-heading">Stage 2: Video & Assesment</h2>

              <p>
                If you are shortlisted, you will receive an email that requires you to make a video about yourself and your aspiration. There will also be a test regarding your chosen field as well as a virtual group interview.
              </p>

              <p>
                For our batch, due to covid-19, the selection process is a whole lot different than the normal one. It is quite a new norm to attend the interview virtually. First off, if you are shortlisted, you will receive an email from JPA to notify you with the date and time. Candidates who applied for JPA PPN have a high probability of being in one of the early sessions. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Next, you need to make a video about yourself, your family, as well as your aspirations. I still remember recording this video a few times, wearing a blazer, and editing it to make it run smoothly. I enjoy the process of making this video as I got some help from my younger sister (who was the one who filmed me). There were a few bloopers that made it a fun and unforgettable memory. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Other than that, you will be required to take one more test regarding your chosen career path. You need to take this SERIOUSLY, because it will also determine what course and where you will be assigned to (besides the interview and the video). Answer truthfully based on your interests and dreams. You will be the one who will have to undergo a long and difficult journey ahead, so choose something that you really enjoy or something that you can manage.
              </p>

              <h2 class="section-heading">Stage 3: The Interview</h2>

              <p>
                Here comes the final stage, which is the most important stage that you need to ace. You will be assigned to a group, and each group will consist of 4 to 5 people. For me, my friend and I were grouped together, so the interview was less nerve-racking. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Make sure your camera and microphone are working to avoid problems during the interview, but do not worry, there will be a technician and JPA officer who will test your camera, microphone, and internet to make sure they are functioning well before you enter the interview session or the meeting with the interviewers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Personally, I have a bad memory about this, because I did not prepare beforehand and just assumed that my computer had a good microphone system. During microphone testing, they could not hear me clearly and I panicked but luckily, the officer called me and helped me fix my microphone problem and my username problem. 
              </p>

              <p>
                They were kind enough to wait for me to enter again patiently, and I felt so guilty at that time. I hope that this will not happen to you guys. Moral of the story, be punctual and make sure your devices are working well. Another thing is to make sure that you have nice lighting and that you are in a quiet, peaceful environment. This ensures that you can stay focused and allows you to hear the questions clearly, so that you can give your best answers and perform well.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I suggest that you prepare beforehand (e.g. practice speaking and enhancing your general knowledge). The most common question that will be asked is to tell the interviewers about yourself. I suggest that you plan and draft how you want to answer this question so that you can tackle this type of question easily. You can talk about your dream, your background and your family. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The questions will be asked in both Malay and English, it depends on what language the interviewer used to ask that question. I believe that there will be three different types of questions regarding your future career, current news, and general knowledge. For me, they asked me 5 questions, such as why I chose the United Kingdom, my thoughts on TikTok as a platform for education, as well as my targeted university.
              </p>

              <p>
                When it comes to general knowledge, you really need to do a lot of reading and research. Do you know the current Malaysian Minister of Education? If you don’t, better search it up now! :)
              </p>

              <p>
                Don’t be nervous, and try to answer all of the questions as best as you can. Always remember to be humble and professional. When the interview ends, do not forget to say thank you to the interviewers and the officers that helped you earlier.
              </p>

              <h2 class="section-heading">Closing Remarks</h2>
              <p>
               I guess that’s all from me, I hope that you have gained some useful information and new knowledge that can be helpful for you in some way :) I feel grateful to be a JPA PPN scholar and very excited for my future. 
              </p>

              <p>       
                Who knows, maybe you will be the next one! Together we can do our best for our beloved country. Regardless of the result you’ll receive, don’t get discouraged. Perhaps there is another and better opportunity in the future for you. Who knows! Just keep exploring and do your best in everything you do. Goodluck!

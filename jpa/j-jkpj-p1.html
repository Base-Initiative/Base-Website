              <p>
                Particularly in my case, JPA advertises Political Science and
                Business Management under the name ‘Social Science’. Therefore,
                if you are an aspiring psychologist or linguistic professor,
                this scholarship will not suit you exactly. It is also important
                to know that JPA-JKPJ is not a full scholarship but rather a
                loan, in which you will have to pay for a certain amount if you
                fail to (or choose not to) work for government bodies.
              </p>
              <h2 class="section-heading">Application</h2>

              <p>
                I cannot exactly remember every detail of this particular
                application phase, but I was given an extensive list of courses,
                mostly engineering courses with varying countries, with
                differing requirements. The engineering courses (if I remember
                correctly), require A or A+ in Sciences and Mathematics
                subjects, which for me at the time was devastating because I
                missed an A for chemistry, which left me with only the option to
                go to France for ‘Social Science’ (which again, is their way of
                saying Political Science and Business Management, though they
                may change it by the time you are applying). After looking
                through the long list of courses (hats off to JPA for offering
                such a variety of courses), I had to fill an online form to
                indicate which course I am interested in.
              </p>

              <h2 class="section-heading">Personality Test</h2>

              <p>
                After some time, I checked the JPA website for updates, and
                there was a link for a personality test. Here, I have to note
                that, because JPA offers many types of scholarships for many
                levels of studies, there is an abundance of links on the website
                that will lead you to different parts of different scholarship
                applications, so make sure that you click on the link for
                JPA-JKPJ.
              </p>

              <p>
                In this test, there are more than a hundred questions that test
                your values and morals. I could not say for sure what kind of
                personality they were looking for but hey, I got the
                scholarship. I think it is obvious that you do not have to study
                for this test. Any hints of advice would be to stay true to your
                own self.
              </p>

              <h2 class="section-heading">Video Essay</h2>

              <p>
                In this video essay aspect, you will be given a prompt. I am
                unsure if the prompt changes every year but I was given one
                where I had to explain firstly in Malay, the reasons for my
                application and secondly in English, where I had to tell them of
                my aspirations. I cannot recall if there was a designated dress
                code but based on the video I made, I wore a formal attire; a
                white shirt, black slacks and a tie.
              </p>

              <h2 class="section-heading"><i>The Interview</i></h2>

              <p>
                Due to the pandemic, I had an online interview, which was
                fortunate for me in some aspects. The interview was conducted in
                a group of 5, certain questions in Malay and others in English.
                For the content of the interview, the only advice I have for you
                is so that you have a strong personal conviction for why you
                want the scholarship.
              </p>

              <p>
                Do not be flimsy with your answers and be enthusiastic. On the
                technical side however, (if the interview is done online this
                year) make sure that you have a pair of earphones, a fairly good
                webcam (might be optional but hey, there may be extra marks for
                good lighting), and an especially good internet connection.
              </p>

              <p>
                For the webcam aspect, I find that a good enough camera is
                important to properly convey your body language, which I
                consider is quite important to express myself, but it depends on
                you. Be confident, it is okay to stutter (don’t do it
                intentionally though) and have good values. Interviews can be in
                the morning or afternoon, depending on JPA. They will send you
                an email that includes the instructions and the link for the
                interview a few days before, so do not fret.
              </p>
              <h2 class="section-heading">Closing Remarks</h2>
              <p>
                I feel it is important to note here that, a scholarship is not
                an achievement. It is a responsibility. This is a whole other
                issue to consider but please do remember, and consider how such
                resources and opportunities are limited to a certain group of
                privileged students, and if you are reading this that might
                include you. This essay may be an embodiment of my mistakes and
                regrets during my application process with the JPA-JKPJ
                scholarship, and I hope you would not have any when it is your
                turn. Godspeed.

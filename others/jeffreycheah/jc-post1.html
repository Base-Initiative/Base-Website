            <h2 class="section-heading">Application</h2>
            
            <p>The Jeffrey Cheah Entrance Scholarship is a scholarship or rather a tuition fee waiver that is awarded to students mainly based on their merits. However, while most students would apply for the Entrance Scholarship, there are other Scholarships and Awards that students could potentially apply for, which are the need-based and talent-based scholarships. This essay would be about my experience in obtaining a tuition fee waiver to do my A-Levels at Sunway College.</p>
  
            <p>The major upside of applying for this scholarship is that you have the privilege of being able to choose a pre-university or diploma course to undergo. Sunway College offers a variety, namely A-Levels, Canadian International Matriculation Programme (CIMP), Australian Matriculation (AUSMAT), Monash University Foundation Year (MUFY), Foundation in Arts and Foundation in Science and Technology. Not to forget, the American Degree Transfer Programme (ADTP), where the programme differs in the sense that a student would already be pursuing his degree. Meaning, said student would need to select a major earlier on.</p>
  
            <p>Apropos to the above, it is clear that there are many programmes to choose from and that’s only the Pre-University programmes. There are also diploma and professional accounting programmes that you can choose from. The reason why I’m listing these programmes out as if I’m listing out the menu at a mamak is because it really is that simple! Unlike other scholarships, The Jeffrey Cheah Entrance Scholarship doesn’t require a crazy intense interview session nor does it require you to twist and turn your brain to write a bombastic essay to showcase your personality in the best possible light. You’d only need your SPM slip, and your identification card.</p>

            <p>Since the scholarship is awarded based on your merits, the amount you receive is also based on your merits. All you need is a minimum of 3A’s (A+, A, A-) or for the holy grail, 9A+s for a full scholarship. To apply, you could either head over to the Student Life or Admissions office and submit a form which you could get from the same place. Another option is to apply via the Sunway University/College website. It’s as simple as that! I personally thought that it would be a lot easier to submit my form when I visited the campus to apply for my preferred course.</p>
  
  
            <h2 class="section-heading">Pro tip: 
            </h2>
  
            <p>If you’re unsure of what programme to do or require a more detailed explanation, visit the campus! There are well-qualified officials to help you figure out the best plan to further your studies. </p>
  
            <p>After submitting the application form, your fees would be deducted starting the 2nd semester. From what I believe, as long as you meet the minimum requirement, you’re a shoe-in for a certain amount of a fee waiver. For a more detailed description of the scholarship, check out the website where everything you need to know is organized in the easiest way for you to understand.</p>

            <p>All in all, I hope that this essay helped you understand what other options you have because figuring out what to do for SPM shouldn’t be as grueling a process as perceived to be. “Where there’s a will there’s a way” and on that note, I wish you the best!</p>

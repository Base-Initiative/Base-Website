            <p style="text-align: justify;">If you had told me a year ago that I would be able to not only succeed in my SPM
              examinations but also become a PNB scholar, I wouldn’t have believed you. And as
              I’m writing this, I’m still in disbelief.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">To become a recipient of the PNB Global Scholarship Award is an honour that only a
              selected few would be able to experience. That being said, I’m writing this article in
              hopes that I would be able to help you in your journey to becoming a PNB scholar
              and receive the same honour as well.
              </p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">Before you continue reading, I just want to state a <strong>disclaimer</strong> that this article was largely based on my experience applying in the year 2021 and there might be slight variation with what you would go through.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Without further ado, let’s begin our deep dive into the PNB Global Scholarship
              Award!</p>

            
            
            <!--New Section-->

            <br>

            <h2 style="color: #004AAD;" class="section-heading">What is PNB?</h2>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) is one of the largest fund management
              companies in Malaysia with assets under management (AUM) exceeding RM300
              billion. PNB's portfolio covers strategic investments in Malaysia's leading corporates,
              global equities, private investments and real estate.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">PNB’s vision is to become a distinctive world-class investment house and its mission
              is to enhance the economic wealth of the Bumiputera community and all Malaysians,
              for the <strong> prosperity of the nation</strong>.
              </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to fulfil this mission, a number of ongoing initiatives are undertaken such as
              encouraging Malaysians to generate wealth by investing in Amanah Saham Nasional
              Berhad (ASNB)’s unit trust funds and under its corporate social responsibility (CSR)
              wing, it has sponsored thousands of students through its scholarship programmes
              and Insya-Allah, you’ll be one of them too!
              </p>

            <br>

            <h2 style="color: #004AAD;" class="section-heading">Why become a PNB scholar?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">As a PNB scholar, you’ll receive the following perks:</p>

              <dt><strong>1. World Class Education</strong></dt>
                <dd style="text-align: justify;">Scholars will be able to study at <strong>Kolej Yayasan UEM</strong>, one of Malaysia’s best
                  A-Level colleges, and then pursue an undergraduate degree at a top
                  university in the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, <strong>United States</strong> or <strong>Australia</strong>.

                  <dd style="text-align: justify;">Scholars will be able to receive various forms of support such as <strong>allowances</strong>
                    (e.g., books, laptop, monthly), <strong>care and attention</strong> from supporting staff of the
                    Education Department and <strong>university application preparation classes</strong> with AXIOM
                    Learning.

                      It is important to note that all scholars, irrespective of their chosen course, will
initially serve the bond period as an <strong>investment analyst</strong>.

                  <br>

                  <dt>4. Bright Career Prospects</dt>
                    <dd style="text-align: justify;">After completing their studies, scholars will be able to benefit from <strong>job security</strong>
                      as they will be bonded with PNB for <strong>at least 8 years</strong>. During the span of this
                      period, scholars will acquire the skills of an investment analyst while also
                      <strong>specialising in their chosen fields of study</strong>.
                      </dd>
            </dl>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">I hope that I’ve managed to convince you but even if you’re not, there are plenty
              more perks to look out for!</p>

            <br>

            <h2 style="color: #004AAD;" class="section-heading">How to become a PNB scholar?</h2>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">The application process consists of four stages and in order to participate in the first
              stage, applicants will be required to fulfil some requirements.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">From the academic aspect, applicants are required to obtain a <strong>minimum</strong> of <strong>8As</strong> (A+
              and A only) in their SPM examinations together with a <strong> minimum grade </strong>of <strong>2A</strong>  in English 1119 GCE-O paper (which is equivalent to <strong>B2</strong> in the <strong>CEFR</strong> grading system).
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">From the personality aspect, applicants are also expected to have been <strong> active </strong> in
              co-curricular and sports activities. Additionally, they are expected to be <strong>team players</strong>
              and possess <strong> good leadership qualities </strong> and <strong> communication skills</strong>.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Last but not least, only individuals who have <strong>not exceeded</strong> 19 years of age are
              allowed to apply for this scholarship.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Do you meet the requirements? If so, let’s continue forward!
            </p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="section-heading">Stage 1</h2>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">To apply for the PNB Global Scholarship Award, applicants can complete the
              application form on <a href="https://www.pnb.com.my">www.pnb.com.my</a>. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">In this application form, applicants are required to fill up their personal information
              <strong>accurately</strong> as incomplete forms will be rejected straightaway. One of the most
              important details to fill up is the top three course choices in which you’re interested to
              pursue and as mentioned earlier, it’s wise to take the time and effort to ensure that
              the chosen courses not only <strong>relate to PNB’s core investments </strong> but are the ones in
              which you’re <strong>passionate </strong> about.              
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">And as a new addition for applications starting from the year 2022, applicants are required to write an
              <strong>essay</strong> on an <i>‘experience / situation during schooling / college that has the biggest
              impact on the candidate’</i>.
              </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Essay-writing can feel daunting even more so if the success of your application
              depends on it. Nonetheless, let’s switch our perspective for a moment and realise
              that by writing an essay, we are able to convey certain information that wouldn’t be
              possible nor done as effectively with a standard application. For instance, with a
              standard application, you could only state that you held the position as the school’s
              Head Prefect, full stop. However, with an essay, you could express how this
              leadership role changed you for the better and this adds <strong>so much depth to your
              character</strong> in the eyes of the application officers.
              </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Will the essay automatically guarantee you a spot in the next stage? <strong>No</strong>. But will it
              help your application? <strong>Yes, especially if it’s written well</strong>.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">And how exactly do you write a good essay? <strong>(1)</strong> self-reflect on the question, <strong>(2)</strong> respond to what the question wants, <strong>(3)</strong> send across a clear message, <strong>(4)</strong> share but don't boast about your achievements and <strong>(5)</strong> gain feedback from others.
              </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Last but not least, there’s also space added for applicants to share more information
              about their past academic achievements and personal skills related to software,
              computer and others such as graphic design and photo editing. Thus, make sure to list or write them down accordingly.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any inquiries, feel free to shoot them an email! Though it is important to
                keep in mind that <strong>good email etiquette </strong> is expected at all times.                
              </p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">Once checked and settled, submit the form together with the <strong>required documents</strong>.</p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="section-heading">Stage 2</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">After just over a week since my application was submitted, I was informed through
              email that I was shortlisted to sit for the online Critical Reasoning Test Battery
              (CRTB) which consists of 3 assessments, namely:</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>1. Verbal Reasoning Test</dt>
                  <dd style="text-align: justify;">For every question in this test, you are presented with a written passage and
                    you are required to answer multiple-choice questions related to the
                    information in that passage which is similar to the opening section of our SPM
                    English Paper 2 (KBSM).

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    However, the questions were harder than the ones in SPM and you would have to analyse the passage carefully to answer correctly.
                    </dd>

                <br>

                <dt>2. Numerical Test</dt>
                    <dd style="text-align: justify;">For every question in this test, you are presented with facts and figures in the
                      form of graphs and tables and you are required to answer multiple-choice
                      questions which are similar to our SPM Mathematics Paper 1 (KBSM).
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once again, the questions were harder than the ones in SPM and you would have to analyse the graphs and tables carefully to answer accurately.
                    </dd>

                <br>

                <dt>3. Inductive Reasoning Test</dt>
                    <dd style="text-align: justify;">For every question in this test, you are presented with sets or series of shapes
                      whereby the objective is to predict the next or missing figure. In simpler
                      words, you are required to analyse the sets to find patterns.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The idea behind this test is to measure our ability to solve problems.
                      </dd>

              </dl>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">In preparation for the tests mentioned above, I did plenty of <strong>practice tests </strong> online
(search on Google!) to prepare myself mentally for these questions and I would say
that it had helped me tremendously to pass this stage. I would also advise
conducting these tests in a <strong>calm and quiet environment</strong> for you to focus properly.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">I have to admit that this stage was quite intimidating as you’re going against so many
              intelligent candidates who are vying for increasingly limited spots to reach the next
              stage(s). Nonetheless, do not let this discourage you nor distract you from the fact
              that you have passed the first stage, and if you keep yourself <strong> level-headed </strong>
              throughout the trials and tribulations and <strong> believe in yourself </strong>, you will be able to
              succeed!
            </p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="section-heading">Stage 3</h2>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">After not hearing from PNB for over two weeks, I finally received an email notifying
              me of an invitation to participate in the online Interview Session. Traditionally, the
              interview sessions would be held physically at Menara PNB but due to the COVID-19
              pandemic, it was altered for my batch.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Interview Session was conducted in groups of 4 and we were asked a mixture of
              <strong>personal</strong> and <strong>critical-thinking questions</strong>. Thankfully, my group was asked more
              personal questions such as “what are your passions?” and “how did you cope with
              the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic?”. However, we were also asked
              questions such as “how would your preferred field of study enable you to contribute
              to PNB’s business?”.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, it is crucial that you do <strong>research</strong> about PNB (e.g. reading its latest Annual
              Report) and find out how your preferred field of study would enable you to contribute
              to the investment house. There’s also no harm in doing research regarding current
              issues such as the rising inflation in Malaysia as they might pose these questions
              and it’s always a nice feeling to be ready. And in order to confront the more personal
              questions, <strong>self-reflection</strong> on one’s values, experiences and achievements
              beforehand can go a long way in helping you answer well.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Most importantly, I would highly recommend you to conduct <strong>mock interviews</strong> with
              your parents, siblings or friends whereby you attempt to answer the questions
              frequently asked by interviewers. Although they are mock interviews, it is best that
              you treat them seriously so that you could simulate how things could go on D-day.
            </p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="section-heading">Stage 4</h2>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">After just a week, I received a much-awaited email notifying me that I had
              successfully reached the final stage of the application process which consists of 3
              components:
            </p>

            <!--Continue From Here on Out-->

            <dl>
              <dt>1. Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ) Session</dt>
                <dd style="text-align: justify;">
                  For every question in this questionnaire, you are presented with 3 statements and you are required to choose which statement reflects your personality the best.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The idea behind this test is to analyse our personalities and it is extremely important that you <strong>stay true to yourself</strong> and be <strong>consistent</strong> with your answers. If you’re worried that you’ll contradict yourself due to you not exactly knowing your personality, then I recommend that you carry out a few OPQs online on your own (which was what I did).

                </dd>

              <br>

              <dt>2. Group Presentation Session</dt>
                <dd style="text-align: justify;">Compared to the previous years, my batch’s Group Presentation Session was
                  conducted quite differently as we were not informed about the <strong>(1)</strong> format of
                  this group presentation, <strong>(2)</strong> topics to research and <strong>(3)</strong> list of group members
                  until the day of the presentation itself. This is in addition to the fact that this
                  session was held virtually rather than physically due to the pandemic.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  Fortunately, after analysing the email addresses of the recipients that received the email from PNB, I was able to spot that 2 of my interview partners, Hana and Damia, succeeded in getting into the final stage as well. Therefore, I took the opportunity to connect with them through email. I have to say that it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made as we were able to prepare for the session together by exchanging messages on WhatsApp and even calling on Google Meet to discuss the potential topics beforehand.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  And here, I just want to slip in a piece of advice that on this journey towards success, it can get quite lonely especially if you don’t know anyone else who’s on the same journey as you. Thus, <strong>be brave to reach out</strong>! And once you’ve found them, it’s so crucial to <strong>work together</strong> as we’re all on the same boat. So when we lift ourselves up, let’s not forget to lift others around as well.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  On the presentation day, we attended the briefing in the morning whereby they informed us that the presentation would be <strong>(1)</strong> in a debate format, <strong>(2)</strong> that the topics will only be informed 1 hour 30 minutes before a group’s presentation and <strong>(3)</strong> our group members. As 50 applicants reached the final stage, PNB had to schedule the Group Presentation Sessions across 2 days with 25 applicants attending each day. 5 groups of 5 were to present on each day and had different time slots.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  Thankfully, Hana and I ended up being part of the same group and since we were part of Group 5, we had a lot of time to not only prepare for the 4.00 PM presentation but also bond well with the other group members, namely Ashraf, Najhan and Aina.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  To prepare ourselves for the debates, we took the time to share our knowledge of the topics we predict will come out and also held 2 practice debates namely about UNDI18 and Studying Overseas Vs Local.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  At exactly 2.30 PM, we were informed that our debate topic was going to be “Change/Transform or be left behind/Change is the only constant in life”. To be frank with all of you, we were so confused about how to interpret this sentence but after clarifying with the officer-in-charge, we basically had to propose or oppose the idea that “change is the only constant in life”.
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  We delegated ourselves to the proposition group (Ilham, Ashraf), the opposition group (Aina, Najhan) and one of us became the moderator (Hana). As  we had already practised beforehand, we were pretty comfortable with the roles that we were about to play, especially Hana who had already volunteered in wanting to become the moderator during the practice sessions.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  While 90 minutes seem like a plentiful of time, time flew by quickly as we not only had to research the topic but also craft our speeches nicely. Additionally, we also had to do a simple Google Slides presentation to accompany our speeches.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  Thankfully, we were able to perform well in our debate. Afterwards, we had to answer a few questions related to the topic as part of the Q&A session with the interviewers. Then, we had to finalise a few personal information for our applications.

              <dt>3. 20-Second Individual Video</dt>
                  <dd style="text-align: justify;">Last but not least, we were required to create a 20-second individual video
                    about ourselves which we uploaded on Google Drive and optionally, on
                    YouTube (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/LjzAByJS9ko">https://youtu.be/LjzAByJS9ko</a>).

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="section-heading">Post-Stage 4</h2>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Not long after, on the 23rd of August 2021, I received the wonderful news that I was
              given the offer to become a recipient of the PNB Global Scholarship Award. As
              mentioned earlier in this article, I am still in disbelief but I am also extremely grateful
              to be able to become a PNB scholar.
              </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">However, the process of accepting the offer was not an easy one for me as I had
              already enrolled in another college to pursue Engineering under another scholarship
              programme. On the other hand, I applied to pursue Philosophy, Politics and
              Economics (PPE) under PNB.
              </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Why did I apply for two different courses? Well, I was interested in both. And what I
              did to determine my preferred field of study was by taking the time to do research
              online, talking to people (e.g. family, friends) and reaching out to industry
              professionals (e.g. engineers, economists, policymakers) and those pursuing the
              field of study in university (e.g. Oxford University Malaysia Club, Cambridge
              University Malaysia Society).
              </p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">And after a week of self-discovery, I found out that I was more interested and
              <strong>passionate</strong> to do Philosophy, Politics and Economics. And knowing that I would be
              able to <strong>apply the knowledge</strong> obtained through a <strong>guaranteed job</strong> at PNB in which I
              can contribute to <strong>nation-building</strong>, I see it as a win-win solution.
              </p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">That being said, I would highly recommend that to any students interested to apply
              for scholarships in the future that you <strong>stick consistently to only one field of study</strong>. I was fortunate enough to decide between Engineering and PPE once I've gotten offers for both, but this is a very rare opportunity.</p>
            
            <br>

            <h2 style="color: #004AAD;" class="section-heading">Reflections</h2>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Before I end, I just want to state that scholarships are very hard to get and I was
              rejected by many scholarship bodies; some even didn’t let me pass the initial stage.
              Therefore, to those who aspire to become a scholar, you must be <strong>resilient</strong> enough to
              not give up and be <strong>brave</strong> enough to reach out to your family, friends, teachers and
              anyone you know for help. And to those folks who have helped me on this journey
              and are currently reading this, thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">To those who are fortunate enough to become a scholar, <strong>appreciate</strong> this opportunity because this is not merely an award that recognises your past achievements nor does it already guarantee you a spot at Harvard. It is a <strong>mandate</strong> for you to continue your journey towards excellence and while I admit that things do get harder post-SPM, you’re given the platform to excel and let’s do our very best to not waste it. </p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Other than that, I also want to emphasise that scholarships are <strong>not the only way </strong> for you to succeed in life post-SPM as there are many people out there who succeed in life even without receiving one. Thus, do not be discouraged if you are not given the chance, and <strong>always strive to do your very best</strong> in all of your future undertakings.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Good luck and thank you!</p>
